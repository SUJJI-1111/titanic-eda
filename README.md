🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to identify survival patterns. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand how factors such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and port of embarkation affected survival chances.

🔍 Steps Performed

Data Loading → Dataset loaded from GitHub raw link.

Data Overview → Checked shape, info, missing values, and descriptive statistics.

Univariate Analysis → Examined single variables (sex, class, age, fare, survival).

Bivariate Analysis → Explored relationships between survival and other features.

Correlation Analysis → Used heatmaps and pairplots to find relationships.

Visualizations → Histograms, bar charts, boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots.

Observations → Key findings documented.

📊 Key Findings

Gender: Females had a survival rate of 74% vs 19% for males.

Class: 1st class passengers survived at 63%, 3rd class at only 24%.

Embarked: Passengers from Cherbourg (55% survival) fared better than Southampton (34%).

Age: Children under 10 years had higher survival rates.

Fare: Higher fare passengers were more likely to survive (wealth advantage).

Overall: Women, children, and wealthier passengers had the best survival chances.

✅ Outcome

By completing this task, we:

Practiced data cleaning and missing value handling.

Explored categorical and numerical features.

Learned how to use statistical summaries and visualization for insights.

Identified survival patterns useful for predictive modeling.

💡 Learning Takeaways

Gained confidence in EDA workflow.

Understood the use of .describe(), .info(), .value_counts().

Practiced visualizations (histplot, boxplot, heatmap, pairplot).

Strengthened ability to interpret data and communicate insights.
